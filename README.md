# Flappy_Bird
Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird that continuously falls due to gravity and must navigate through gaps between pipes by tapping or clicking to make it flap upward. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score by successfully passing through the gaps without hitting obstacles.
